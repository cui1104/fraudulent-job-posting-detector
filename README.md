# fraudulent-job-posting-detector
## Description
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent job postings. Built in a Jupyter Notebook and designed for execution in Google Colab, it leverages Python 3 and various data science libraries to preprocess data, engineer features, and apply predictive models.

## Installation
**Prerequisites:** Python 3.x

**Step 1:** Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` notebook.

**Step 2:** Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
After installing the required packages, open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. The notebook is self-contained and guides you through the process of data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
